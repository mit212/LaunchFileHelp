# LaunchFileHelp
Find more help here: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch

The Example.launch file has a lot of comments to walk you through how to write a launch file. The only thing missing is if you'd like to launch a launch file that is in a package.

That can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/include

Note that you will have to change your CMakeLists.txt file and your package.xml file to accomodate for launch files.
